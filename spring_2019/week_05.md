## Last Week's Accomplishments

We start to implement codes in SQL and PHP. Now we succeeded in setting up all the tables in MySQL. I set up
the index page and was able to finished the searching algorithms. 

## This Week's Plan

Complete the webpage and make most functions work.

## Anything Blocking?

We found it hard to set up one-to-many tables. We will try to make it work this week.
