## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I continued learning PHP and postgreSQL. On Wednesday, the group visited Albany Public Library, met \
with Ken who is the original developer of the software AGENCY, and invited him into the mattermost chat.

> I continued trying to install AGENCY yet still couldn't figure out what is wrong...

## This Week's Plan

> MUST figure out how to install the software AGENCY!

> Meet with the group and talk about the progress everybody made (because of the weather and large \
group meeting, we didn't have time to meet and check everybody's progress)

## Anything Blocking?

> Installing AGENCY...
> nothing else...

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
