## Last Week's Accomplishments

> As a group, we discussed and summarized the demands and requests of Albany Public Library. We also \
> discussed the timeline and milestones based on the demands. 

> I was able to get familiar with PHP and learned the basic syntax of PHP including hello world, variables \
> and types, arrays, strings, loops, functions, and objects. 

> I successfully set up development environment with PHPStorm. I am in half way of installing the software \
> AGENCY on my laptop. I finished setting up the PostgreSQL database. 

## This Week's Plan

> I will finish installing AGENCY and dig into the original code. We will identify the coding standards \
> and style guide. We will identify main changes to be made to AGENCY software to fit the library's requests. 

## Anything Blocking?

> We are stuck on installing AGENCY because some parts of the code are ambiguously explained. We have to \
> figure out what to do with that. Also, reading the code can be tough because it is a big project. It may \
> take a long time. 

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
