## Last Week's Accomplishments

Our small group (APL System from scratch) first learned about Data Modeling stuffs. Based on the information
given by APL, we successfully built our data model including following tables: Incident, Color, Branch, Client,
PermanentBan, ActiveBan, and FacilityIncident. More details can be found in: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EobSrvMzvhFEju-LGI1mMbPugkzTUSk0gR9KZZ6teWA/edit?ts=5c7d3b7f
Also, we built the data model in SqlDBM which is compatible with MS SQL Server & MySQL. 

## This Week's Plan

Starting to develop a simple web page with php. If possible, we want to integrate php with our data base model.

## Anything Blocking?

No much. Some questions to be clarified by APL.
