## Last Week's Accomplishments

After weeks failing with installing AGENCY, we decided to split to two paralleling paths. Basically, 
one group will continue trying to find out AGENCY features , such as installing and updating documents, 
and the other group which I am in will create an APL system from scratch. There is also a group handling 
front end UI/UX design, which can blend into both two groups described. Overall, there is a huge progress 
of everybody figure out what to do specifically in following weeks.

## This Week's Plan

As said, I am in the "building APL system from scratch" group. So, our group will plan on developing a data
model based on the APL requests. By the end of next week, we probably will be able to get the excel from the 
APL. We will now do the database modeling based on what we have in our documents.

## Anything Blocking?

Not at the moment. We will see when developing our data model.
